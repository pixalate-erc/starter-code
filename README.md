## ⚙️ Hardware Configuration 
* **LED grid:** 19 x 19
* **Data Pin:** GPIO 14 
* **LED Type:** WS2812B (NeoPixel)
* **Color Order:** GRB

## Instructions:
1. Install the *Wokwi Simulator" extension on VS code and follow the instructions to request license.
2. Instal the *PlatformIO IDE* extension on VS code as informed earlier. You might need to restart VScode after the installation.
3. Once you hit on new project, it automatically creates few folder, one of which is the 'src' folder under which there is a file called main.cpp. You have to use this to code your simulation.
4. We have provided two files: 'diagram.json' and 'wokwi.json'. Include them in the same root folder.
5. Push your code to the repository to submit.

## ⚠️ Rules
1.  Do not change the pin configuration.
2.  Ensure your code loops infinitely (don't let the lights go dark!).
3.  Comment your code explaining your logic (judges will read this).
